# Analyzing-US-Economic-Data
In this assignment, essential economic indicators from data is extracted and displayed in a Dashboard.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. 
GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less; 
similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better. In this lab, I am examining how changes in GDP 
impact the unemployment rate.
